## üöÄ Getting Started

1. **Fork the repository** on GitHub
2. **Clone your fork** locally:

   ```

## üõ† Ways to Contribute

### 1. Suggesting New Extensions

If you know of a great extension that would fit well in one of our existing packs:

1. **Check existing extensions** in the relevant pack's `package.json`
2. **Open an issue** with the template:
   - Extension name and publisher
   - Why it should be included
   - Which pack it belongs to
   - Brief description of its benefits

### 2. Proposing New Extension Packs

Have an idea for a completely new extension pack? We'd love to hear it!

**Requirements for new packs:**

- Must serve a specific developer audience or use case
- Should include 5-15 carefully curated extensions
- Must not overlap significantly with existing packs
- Should follow our naming convention: `[Technology/Use Case] [Type] Pack`

**Proposal should include:**

- Target audience and use case
- List of proposed extensions with justifications
- Pack name and description
- Icon suggestion (optional)

### 3. Improving Documentation

Help us improve our documentation by:

- Fixing typos or grammar errors
- Adding clearer explanations
- Updating outdated information
- Translating documentation (future feature)
- Adding usage examples

### 4. Reporting Issues

Found a bug or have a suggestion? Please check if an issue already exists before creating a new one.

**For bug reports, include:**

- VS Code version
- Operating system
- Steps to reproduce
- Expected vs. actual behavior
- Screenshots (if applicable)

## üìù Suggesting New Extensions

When suggesting extensions, consider:

### ‚úÖ Good Extensions to Suggest:

- **Actively maintained** (updated within the last year)
- **High quality** (good ratings and reviews)
- **Widely used** by the target community
- **Lightweight** (doesn't significantly slow down VS Code)
- **Compatible** with VS Code's minimum version requirement
- **Unique functionality** not covered by existing extensions

### ‚ùå Extensions to Avoid:

- Deprecated or unmaintained extensions
- Extensions with known security issues
- Overly niche extensions used by very few developers
- Extensions that duplicate functionality of included extensions
- Extensions that require external dependencies not commonly available

## üìã Submission Guidelines

### Pull Request Process:

1. **Ensure your branch is up to date**:

   ```bash
   git fetch upstream
   git rebase upstream/main
   ```

2. **Make your changes** following our guidelines

3. **Test thoroughly** - install and test the pack locally

4. **Update version numbers** in `package.json` if adding/removing extensions

5. **Write a clear commit message**:

   ```
   feat: add [extension-name] to [pack-name]

   - Adds functionality for [specific use case]
   - Improves developer experience for [target audience]
   - Closes #[issue-number]
   ```

6. **Create a pull request** with:
   - Clear title and description
   - Reference to related issues
   - Screenshots (if UI changes)
   - Testing instructions

### Review Process:

- All PRs require review from maintainers
- We may request changes or ask questions
- Once approved, we'll merge and publish updates

## üìä Extension Pack Guidelines

### Quality Standards:

- **Maximum 15 extensions** per pack (to avoid bloat)
- **Minimum 5 extensions** per pack (to provide value)
- All extensions must be **actively maintained**
- Extensions should have **good community ratings** (4+ stars preferred)
- Must work with **VS Code minimum version** specified in `package.json`

### Naming Conventions:

- Pack names should be descriptive and specific
- Use title case for display names
- Keep descriptions under 200 characters
- Include relevant keywords for discoverability
